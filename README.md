# Linear System Solver


This is a Python application that solves linear equations using various methods including Gaussian Elimination, Matrix Inversion, Jacobi Iteration, and Gauss-Seidel Iteration.

## Getting Started

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed.

1. Download the file to your local machine:
Open in VS code or which python runner you're using 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
bash/terminal 
cd Linear-System-Solver
3. Install the necessary dependencies (ensure you have tkinter, numpy, matplotlib):
bash/terminal 
pip install numpy matplotlib
4. Run the application:
bash/terminal 
python Linear_System_Solver.py

## Usage
Upon running the application, a GUI window will appear.
- Select the solution method from the dropdown menu.
- Enter coefficients and constants as required.
If using Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel methods, enter the number of iterations and convergence tolerance.
- Click the "Solve" button to obtain the solution.
- The solution and steps (if applicable) will be displayed in the text area.
- Use the "Error" button to calculate and display error estimation tables and graphs (for iterative methods).
